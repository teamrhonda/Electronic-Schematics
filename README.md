Wire the circuit following the schematics or the breadboard wiring layout in the fritzling file. The following steps of wiring your circuits are provided for reference.

1. Plug the Arduino Nano Board to the breadboard.

2. Plug the L293D motor driver to the breadboard.

3. Plug the resistors to the breadboard.

4. Wire these components following the schematics and the breadboard wiring layout.

5. Solder wires onto the button jack.

6. Tape the button jack on one side of the breadboard using electrical tape.

7. Solder wires onto the toggle switch.

8. Tape the toggle switch on the same side of the breadboard using electrical tape.

9. Secure the placements of the button jack and the toggle switch with a zip tie.

10. Plug the wires of the button jack and the toggle switch to the corresponding positions based on the schematics and the breadboard wiring layout figure.

11. Solder wires onto the limit switch.

12. Solder wires onto the motor.

13. You might want to connect the motor and the limit switch to the circuit after you are done with the mechanical assembly.

14. Plug the click button into the button jack.
